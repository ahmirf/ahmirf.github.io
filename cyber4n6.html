<h3>Cyber4n6 Program Details</h3>

<p>
<strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
<img class="center" src="img/crimescene.png" alt="">
Digital forensics revolves around the definition of forensics as “science serving the law”.
The technical skills in this area are in high demand in industry and government.
With the continuous challenge that cyber-crime presents to the U.S. industry,
many corporations are interested in a workforce equipped with digital forensics skills.
The <a href="https://www.cyberseek.org/pathway.html">NIST cyberseek tool</a> identifies
cyber-crime analyst as one of the four entry-level roles, leading to three mid-level roles of
cybersecurity analyst, cybersecurity consultant, and penetration and vulnerability tester.
</p>
<p>
Cyber4n6 is an industry-focused experiential learning program in digital forensics
in direct partnership with the Computer Evidence Recovery Section (CERS) at Virginia State Police (VSP).
The CERS is a section of the <a href="https://vsp.virginia.gov/sections-units-bureaus/bci/high-tech-crimes-division-2/">High Tech Crimes Division</a>
established in 2009 to fight against computer crimes.
</p>
<p>
Cyber4n6 program has two tracks:
</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Investigator track</em> to explore practical skills for solving cybercrime cases, and
</li>
<li><em>Developer track</em> to create new tools to add missing forensic capabilities.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Program Implementation</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Compliance with VSP policies.</strong></em> Cyber4n6 program will comply with VSP policies and requirements.
</li>
<li><em><strong>Program size.</strong></em> The program will consist of 10 students per year recruited within Virginia.
</li>
<li><em><strong>Program duration.</strong></em> Almost 12 months to learn the practical skillset of forensic investigation and be useful for the CERS lab.
<img class="center" src="img/acquisition.jpg" alt="">
</li>
<li><em><strong>Participants’ stipend and time commitment.</strong></em> The participants will commit 10 hours per week for almost one year. They will be paid $15 per hour. VSP and VCU will maintain their timesheet and periodically inform the Cyber4n6 team about the students’ lack of commitment, interest, and other issues. The team will intervene and resolve the problems to help the students be back on track.
</li>
<li><em><strong>Student commute and time management.</strong></em> The students will split 10 hours into two days a week to save their commute time and make their visits to the CERS lab and VCU's SAFE lab more productive.
</li>
<li><em><strong>Participant recruitment.</strong></em> The program will open to all undergraduate junior/senior and graduate students of computer science, computer engineering, and other relevant programs within Virginia.
Undergrads must have a minimum GPA of 2.8, while master's students must have a GPA of 3.2 or above.
The ideal candidates must also have demonstrated interest in cybersecurity, e.g., participated in capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions, involved with a cybersecurity club at their universities, etc.
</li>
<li><em><strong>VSP certificate of completion.</strong></em> VSP will issue a completion certificate to successful participants.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Other Program Activities</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Knowledge sharing sessions.</strong></em>
The program will have regular knowledge-sharing sessions in a hybrid mode, both Zoom and in person at VCU, to encourage students to share their knowledge, new skills, and experiences with other participants.
<p></p>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Poster competition.</strong></em>
The students will participate in a poster competition at the end of the program, reflecting students’ acquired knowledge and experience.
Industry representatives will also be invited. Top three posters will receive an award certificate and a gift.
</li>
</ul>
